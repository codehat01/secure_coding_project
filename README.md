# Falcon Post Quantum Signature Verification

This project provides a Python implementation for **Falcon Post Quantum Signature Verification**. It includes a pre-built `.whl` file and a Python script for demonstrating how to verify post-quantum signatures using the Falcon algorithm, a lattice-based signature scheme designed to provide secure digital signatures even in the presence of quantum computing.

## Overview

**Falcon** is a post-quantum secure digital signature algorithm based on the **NIST PQC standards**. It uses lattice-based cryptography, which is highly resistant to quantum-based attacks, making it ideal for securing data and communications in a post-quantum era. This project includes a sample `.whl` file and a Python program to verify signatures using Falcon.

## Installation

To use this project, you need to have Python installed (version 3.6 or higher is recommended). Follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository** (if applicable):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/falcon-pqs-verification.git
    cd falcon-pqs-verification
    ```

2. **Install the WHL file**:
   - Locate the `.whl` file included in this project (e.g., `falcon_pqs-0.1-py3-none-any.whl`).
   - Install it using `pip`:
     ```bash
     pip install falcon_pqs-0.1-py3-none-any.whl
     ```

3. **Install Dependencies**:
    - If there are additional dependencies, install them using the requirements file:
      ```bash
      pip install -r requirements.txt
      ```

---

## Usage

After installation, you can run the provided Python program to verify signatures using the Falcon algorithm.

1. **Running the Verification Script**:
   - The verification script (`verify_signature.py`) requires an input file with the digital signature and the corresponding public key.
   - Run the script as follows:
     ```bash
     python verify_signature.py --signature <path/to/signature_file> --public_key <path/to/public_key_file>
     ```

2. **Example Command**:
    ```bash
    python verify_signature.py --signature sample.sig --public_key sample.pub
    ```

3. **Expected Output**:
   - The script will output whether the signature is **valid** or **invalid**.
